## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark indigo (#312F4F), lending a sophisticated and trustworthy feel. It will contrast well against the light background.
- Background color: Very light grayish-purple (#F7F7FA) provides a clean, neutral backdrop, similar in hue to the primary color, with low saturation for subtlety.
- Accent color: Red-violet (#A32CA8), adds vibrancy and highlights key interactive elements. The hue sits near the primary on the color wheel but shifts toward red, increasing contrast and visibility.
- Font: 'Gilroy-SemiBold' (sans-serif) for all text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a clean, structured layout to showcase form elements. Ensure that related form input elements are located close to one another on the form.
- Employ white space to clearly delineate each section of the form
